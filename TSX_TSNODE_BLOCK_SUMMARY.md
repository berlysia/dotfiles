# tsx/ts-node Block Implementation Summary

## üîí Security Policy Enforcement Complete

### Problem Addressed
- tsx and ts-node were being used despite being completely forbidden
- Test files contained `npx tsx --test` commands that bypassed the blocking hooks
- The blocking mechanism wasn't comprehensive enough to catch all usage patterns

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced block-tsx.ts Hook
- **Comprehensive Pattern Matching**: Now blocks all forms of tsx/ts-node usage including:
  - Direct commands: `tsx file.ts`, `ts-node script.ts`
  - Via npx: `npx tsx file.ts`
  - In shell commands: `sh -c "tsx file.ts"`
  - With find -exec: `find . -exec tsx {} \;`
  - With xargs: `ls | xargs tsx`
  - With parallel: `parallel tsx ::: *.ts`
  - Package installation: `npm/yarn/pnpm/bun install tsx`

- **Smart Context Detection**: Properly distinguishes between:
  - ‚ùå Blocked: `tsx script.ts` (command execution)
  - ‚úÖ Allowed: `cat Component.tsx` (file extension)
  - ‚úÖ Allowed: `echo "tsx is blocked"` (in strings)
  - ‚úÖ Allowed: `vim test.tsx` (editing files)

#### 2. Test Infrastructure Updates
- Replaced `npx tsx --test` with `bun test` in run-tests.sh
- Updated all hook implementations to use local cc-hooks-ts module
- Fixed test expectations to align with strict "ÂÖ®Èù¢ÁöÑ„Å´Á¶Å„Åò„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã" policy

#### 3. Verification
- All 24 unit tests passing
- Custom test suite confirms correct blocking behavior
- File extensions and string mentions properly allowed
- Command execution properly blocked in all contexts

### Files Modified
1. `/dot_claude/hooks/implementations/block-tsx.ts` - Enhanced blocking logic
2. `/dot_claude/hooks/tests/unit/run-tests.sh` - Removed tsx usage
3. `/dot_claude/hooks/tests/unit/block-tsx.test.ts` - Updated test expectations
4. `/dot_claude/hooks/cc-hooks-ts.ts` - Created local module definition

### Security Status
‚úÖ **SECURE** - tsx and ts-node are now completely blocked with no known bypass methods

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Monitor for any new bypass attempts
2. Consider adding telemetry to track blocked attempts
3. Update documentation to clarify the strict no-tsx/ts-node policy
4. Regular security audits of all hook implementations
