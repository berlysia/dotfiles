# /commit

Commits current changes with semantic commit messages. Automatically handles simple and complex scenarios.

## Workflow

```
/commit
    │
    ├─ Check for changes (staged + unstaged)
    │
    ├─ Analyze change complexity
    │   │
    │   ├─ Simple (single purpose) → Direct commit
    │   │   - Generate semantic commit message
    │   │   - Stage and commit
    │   │
    │   └─ Complex (multiple types mixed) → Delegate to /semantic-commit
    │       - Automatic analysis and splitting
    │       - Multiple atomic commits
    │
    └─ Report result
```

## Complexity Detection

**Simple** (handle directly):
- Single file with one type of change
- Multiple files with same purpose (e.g., all feat, all fix)
- Related changes that form one logical unit

**Complex** (delegate to `/semantic-commit`):
- Mixed change types (feat + fix, refactor + test)
- Large refactoring spanning many files
- Changes that should be split for better git history

## Implementation

### Step 1: Gather Information

```bash
# Check status
git status

# View changes
git diff
git diff --cached

# Check recent commit style
git log --oneline -5
```

### Step 2: Analyze Complexity

Examine the changes and determine:
1. How many distinct purposes are present?
2. Are there mixed change types (feat/fix/refactor/test/docs/chore)?
3. Would splitting improve the git history?

### Step 3: Execute

**If Simple:**
1. Stage all changes: `git add <files>`
2. Generate commit message following CLAUDE.md conventions
3. Commit with semantic message

**If Complex:**
1. Inform user: "Multiple change types detected. Using /semantic-commit for intelligent splitting."
2. Delegate to `/semantic-commit` command

## Commit Message Format

Follow CLAUDE.md conventions:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body - explain WHY, not WHAT]

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### Type Selection

| Type | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring (no behavior change) |
| `test` | Test additions/modifications |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `chore` | Maintenance (deps, config) |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `style` | Formatting (no logic change) |
| `build` | Build system |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes |

## Examples

### Simple Case: Single Feature

```
Changes:
- src/auth/login.ts (new login function)
- src/auth/types.ts (new types)

→ Direct commit:
  feat(auth): add login functionality
```

### Simple Case: Bug Fix

```
Changes:
- src/utils/parser.ts (fix null check)

→ Direct commit:
  fix(utils): handle null input in parser
```

### Complex Case: Mixed Types

```
Changes:
- src/auth/login.ts (bug fix)
- src/auth/session.ts (new feature)
- tests/auth.test.ts (new tests)

→ Delegate to /semantic-commit
  "Multiple change types detected (fix, feat, test).
   Delegating to /semantic-commit for intelligent splitting."
```
